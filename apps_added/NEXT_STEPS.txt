Django project detected. I added models stubs under apps_added/:
- profiles_models.py
- posts_models.py

Next steps (locally):
1. Move these model contents into actual apps (python manage.py startapp profiles), paste models, add to INSTALLED_APPS.
2. Run makemigrations and migrate.
3. Implement serializers and views (DRF recommended) and update URLs.
